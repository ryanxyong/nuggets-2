# CS50 21S Nuggets

## Design Spec

In this document we reference the requirements spec and focus on the implementation-independent design decisions.

We focus on the core subset:

- User interface
- Inputs and outputs
- Function decomposition into modules
- Pseudocode for logic/algorithmic flow
- Major data structures
- Testing plan

## User interface

As described in the [Requirements Spec](REQUIREMENTS.md), the server moduleâ€™s
only interface with the user is on the command-line; it must always have either one or two arguments.
`./server map.txt [seed]`

For example 
`./server map3.txt 2`

## Inputs and outputs

### Input:

Server: The server reads the pathname for a map file to be used for generating the map and, optionally, a seed to be used for random-number generation (must be a positive integer).
During the running of the game, the player will send a message to the server `PLAY real name`

### Key stroke inputs

These are taken in as a request from the client that the server must handle.
We will only move the player if the request to the new location is valid.

- `Q` quit the game
- `h` move left
- `H` move all the way left
- `l` move right
- `L` move all the way right
- `j` move down
- `J` move all the way down
- `k` move up
- `K` move all the way up
- `y` move diagonally up and left
- `Y` move all the way diagonally up and left
- `u` move diagonally up and right
- `U` move all the way diagonally up and right
- `b` move diagonally down and left
- `B` move all the way diagonally down and left
- `n` move diagonally down and right
- `N` move all the way diagonally down and right
	
### Output:

Server: The server will not print anything but will log information into a logfile with the command: `./server 2>server.log map.txt`.
At the end of the game, the server will output a gameover summary.

## Functional decomposition into modules

### Server modules/functions

1. main, which parses arguments, initializes global variables, and starts the game for clients to join.
2. initGameState, which initializes the global variables for the game.
3. parseArgs, which makes user-inputted arguments usable for the program.
4. handleMessage, which delegates the action requested by the client to a helper function.
5. handleSpectate, which is a helper function for `handleMessage` that creates a spectator.
6. handlePlay, which is a helper function for `handleMessage` that creates a player.
7. handleKey, which is a helper function for `handleMessage` that processes player movement and quitting.
8. moveHelper, which is a helper function for `handleKey` that moves the player and processes gold and player interactions too.
9. reposPlayers, which updates all players' grids.
10. resetLiveGrid, which cleans the live grid of all player ID characters.
11. formatName, which formats a user-inputted name by truncating and replacing non-graph and non-blank characters with underscores.
12. sendSummaryMsg, which sends a summary message with player stats.
13. sendGoldMsg, which sends a gold message with updated gold counts.
14. sendGridMsg, which sends a grid message with the grid size.
15. sendDisplayMsg, which sends a display message with the latest version of a player's grid.
16. sendOkMsg, which sends an ok message to confirm that the player joined the game.
17. calcDigits, which calculates the number of digits in a number.
18. findPlayer, which finds a player given their player ID.
19. str2int, which converts a string form of an integer to an actual integer type value.

## Major data structures

- gameState (in server program):
    - static grid
    - live grid
    - number of gold piles left
    - array of players
    - address for spectator
    - number of players joined
    - next available player ID
    - number of nuggets left in the game

- grid (in grid module):
    - number of rows in grid
    - number of columns in grid
	- Two-dimensional array of characters 

- player (in player module):
	- player ID
	- player name
	- player address
	- column position
	- row position
	- number of gold nuggets collected by the player
	- player-specific grid based on visibility
	- quit boolean

## Testing plan

### Unit testing

Unit testing will be performed for the `player` and `grid` modules.

- Testing the player module
    The grid module is mainly tested with print statements, invoking its different functions to create and manipulate a grid. The following main tests are performed:
    - player creation
    - player movements
    - player getter methods to ensure that they all work properly.
    - update player data, such as number of gold nuggets
    - player deletion

- Testing the grid module
    The grid module is mainly tested with print statements, invoking its different functions to create and manipulate a grid. The following main tests are performed:
	- grid creation
    - grid printing
    - grid updating
	- grid getter methods to ensure that all the methods work properly.
    - grid deletion

### Integration/system testing

All integration/system tests will be run with valgrind to ensure that the varied tests do not produce memory leaks.

Our main tests for this section will be manual testing and automated testing. Both types of testing will make use of the `player` program provided in the shared directory `~/cs50-dev/shared/nuggets/`.

We will perform our tests on a variety of map files provided in the `maps` directory, including a map file of our own design. 

By manually playing the game, the team will test: 
    - edge cases, such as:
        - maxing out player count
		- replacing spectator with new spectator (if one is present)
		- attempting to move past a barrier and bounds of the grid
    - normal (valid) movements
    - random behavior by seed generation

We will perform automated testing to further ensure that movements are handled properly and do not break the game.
       
## Division of Work Plan

Each member will be coding one of the following programs/modules:

- Server program: Ryan
- Player module: Neha
- Grid module: Grace

In case one member finishes their part early, they will help out in implementing the other two program/modules (if necessary).

In regards to testing, each member writing a program/module will be responsible for unit testing their program/module to make later integration/system testing as smooth as possible. (Refer to testing plan section for more information.)

As for integration/system testing the server program, members will collectively work together to produce a driver file to test out various cases for the server.
